# Springboard-Data-Wrangling

This exercise is an attempt on data wrangling. The source file is 'world_bank_projects.json' provided by Springboard and http://jsonstudio.com/resources/.

The questions are as follows:
1. Find the 10 countries with most projects
2. Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
3. In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.
